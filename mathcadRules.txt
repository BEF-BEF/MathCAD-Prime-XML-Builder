<eval> Element:

This tag initiates a mathematical evaluation in Mathcad.
It must contain a single child, <apply>.
<apply> Element:

Represents a specific mathematical operation.
Can contain child tags <minus>, <mult>, <pow>, <parens>, <div>.

Operation Elements (<minus>, <mult>, <pow>, <parens>, <div>):

They encapsulate specific mathematical operations.
All these operations can have children representing the operands.
For nested operations, an <apply> child can be used.
The order of operations follows the natural mathematical hierarchy:
<parens> (Parentheses are evaluated first.)
<pow> (Exponentiation)
<mult> and <div> (Multiplication and Division)
<minus> (Subtraction)
In the context of MathCAD reading this XML, the deepest nested levels will be processed first.
Other Elements:

<id>: Represents a variable. Cannot be a direct child of <apply>.
<real>: Represents a real number. Cannot be a direct child of <apply>.
Attributes:

Make sure to correctly assign attributes, especially ones like labels, xml:space, label-is-contextual, region-id, etc., based on their defined meanings and contexts.
Element Order:

The order in which elements appear matters, especially for operations. For example, in subtraction <minus>, the order of child elements defines the minuend and subtrahend.
Avoid Redundant Nesting:

Unnecessary nesting (like using <apply> without an actual operation) can cause confusion or errors. Ensure that only necessary elements are included.
Remember, it's essential to adhere to these rules strictly. Even a minor discrepancy, like a missing tag or an attribute, can result in errors when the XML is parsed by Mathcad.
